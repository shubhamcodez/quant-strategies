# Factor Modeling and Portfolio Optimization
=============================================

## Project Overview
This project develops a fundamental factor model using six key factors: Profitability, Dividend Yield, Value, Market Sensitivity, Medium-Term Momentum, and Short-Term Momentum. The model is designed to capture changing market conditions and improve portfolio efficiency.

## Key Features
#### Fundamental Factor Model
* Uses six key factors: Profitability, Dividend Yield, Value, Market Sensitivity, Medium-Term Momentum, and Short-Term Momentum
* ##### Factor Orthogonalization
	+ Reduces factor correlations and improves diversification
* ##### Cross-Sectional Regression
	+ Estimates factor loadings and computes returns
* ##### Portfolio Optimization and Performance Evaluation
	+ QLIKE random portfolio tests, minimum variance portfolio tests, and cluster analysis on high and low turnover factors
	+ Achieved an annual return of 21% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.109, with a robust R-squared of 0.11
